Cycle time data for automotive plant to study OEE and time study


All 10 tables are created. Here's the schema structure:

Table	Purpose
production_lines	Body shop, paint, assembly, etc.
workstations	Individual stations within each line
shifts	Day, evening, night shift definitions
operators	Workers with skill levels
products	Vehicle models being produced
production_runs	Shift-level production tracking
cycle_time_observations	Individual cycle times per unit (core time study data)
downtime_events	Equipment failures, changeovers, etc.
quality_defects	Defects by type and severity
oee_summary	Calculated availability, performance, quality rates

Let me generate this data step by step. With 1 month of 3-shift operations across 4 lines at 400 units/shift, we'll have substantial cycle time data. I'll start with the reference data.


The OEE is running a bit lower than targeted (~62% average). Let me verify the overall data and show you a summary:
