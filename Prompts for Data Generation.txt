Cycle time data for automotive plant to study OEE and time study


All 10 tables are created. Here's the schema structure:

Table	Purpose
production_lines	Body shop, paint, assembly, etc.
workstations	Individual stations within each line
shifts	Day, evening, night shift definitions
operators	Workers with skill levels
products	Vehicle models being produced
production_runs	Shift-level production tracking
cycle_time_observations	Individual cycle times per unit (core time study data)
downtime_events	Equipment failures, changeovers, etc.
quality_defects	Defects by type and severity
oee_summary	Calculated availability, performance, quality rates

Let me generate this data step by step. With 1 month of 3-shift operations across 4 lines at 400 units/shift, we'll have substantial cycle time data. I'll start with the reference data.


The OEE is running a bit lower than targeted (~62% average). Let me verify the overall data and show you a summary:

// The website is https://fabricate.tonic.ai/databases/ai/d565080c-c791-4ac2-b736-393a359ad9ae/tables/cycle_time_observations

Table	Records	Description
production_lines	4	Body Shop, Paint Shop, Trim & Chassis, Final Assembly
workstations	49	10-14 stations per line with standard cycle times
shifts	3	Day, Evening, Night (24-hour operation)
operators	60	Junior to Lead skill levels
products	3	Sedan, SUV, Crossover (varying complexity)
production_runs	264	22 days × 3 shifts × 4 lines
cycle_time_observations	118,846	Individual unit cycle times (12% sampling)
downtime_events	1,067	Equipment failures, changeovers, etc.
quality_defects	2,040	Weld, paint, fit/finish defects
oee_summary	264	Calculated A × P × Q per shift


Key Metrics
Average OEE: 61.8% (realistic for improvement opportunities)
Availability: ~74% (Equipment Failure is top loss at 11K minutes)
Performance: ~87%
Quality: ~97.5%
Total Production: ~400 units/shift across the month
The data includes realistic patterns like:

First-piece cycle times running ~15-30% longer
Bottleneck stations with higher variability
Product complexity affecting cycle times (SUV +15%)
Downtime weighted toward equipment failures and changeovers
Defect types aligned with production line types (weld defects in Body Shop, paint defects in Paint Shop, etc.)
